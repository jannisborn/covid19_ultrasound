## 4.0.1 - 2019-09-25

### Fixed
- installation command used a wrong service provider for Elfinder;


## 4.0.0 - 2019-09-24

### Added
- merged #1955 - ```image``` field type has a new ```max_file_size``` option; which defaults to the defaults to ```upload_max_filesize``` set in PHP;
- merged #1913 - new design based on CoreUI, instead of AdminLTE; 
- developers can now add widgets to the top/bottom of the operation views;
- ```CRUD``` facade, so developers can now do ```CRUD::addField()``` instead of ```$this->crud->addField()```;
- the ability for developers to use a different CrudPanel object instead of the one in the package; this way, they can customize/overwrite how anything works inside the CrudPanel object;
- routes are now defined inside operations; you no longer need to edit the route file to add routes to one controller; you can now re-use an operation on different controllers and it will also add the necessary routes;
- merged #2012 - phone column type;
- merged #1997 - settings API;
- when specifying a route to an EntityCrudController, an "operation" is specified for each action; that "operation" is used as the string name of the operation (basically doing setOperation() automatically); there are currently two ways to set the current operation: (1) by defining the operation when defining the route, and (2) by doing setOperation()
- inside each operation action, it's no longer required to run ```setOperation()```; but IT IS required to run ```setConfigurationFromSettings()``` so that anything that was inside operation closures gets run;
- All Backpack/Base functionality inside Backpack\CRUD;
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#384 - Ability to toggle breadcrumbs on/off;
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#385 - NPM and Laravel Mix for CSS & JS dependencies;
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#385 - By default Backpack\Base no longer loads anything from CDNs;
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#387 - Easily add scripts/style to all admin panes, using asset() or mix();
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#387 - Easily remove the bundled js and css and use CDNs if you want to;
- Laravel-Backpack/Base#380 - New design - Backstrap, based on CoreUI;
- [Webfactor/Laravel-Generators](https://github.com/webfactor/laravel-generatorssu) to the installation command;
- the Create and Update operations only save the values of the fields (determined using the name attribute); anything else it ignores; this is for security reasons - to prevent saving fields that have been inserted in the front-end maliciously; 
- field types can now have arrays for names, instead of strings; when a field type wants to save multiple attributes, it should have all of them as array in the "name" field attribute; this makes sure that they will get saved in the database;
- support for Right-to-Left languages (just change a variable in the base config file);


### Fixed
- merged #1984 fixes #1952 and #1981 - ```table``` fied type has been rewritten using JQuery instead of Angular, for consistency;
- merged #1977 - fields, filters and operations now use LOCAL assets, instead of CDNs; Backpack can now be used on intranets;
- merged #1947 fixes #1927 - package version was often incorrect, due to maintainers not updating the number on each patch release; fixed by using ocramius/package-versions to determine the package version;
- merged #1950 - reorder operation is now twice as fast;
- merged #1994 - moved SaveActions to the CrudPanel object, since they're not an operation;
- delete button now shows up (and works) in the Show operation view;
- for the List operation, the default order is now by primary key DESC (instead of ASC); backwards-compatible, in that if a different order has been set for the primary key, that one will be used instead;
- we've reduced the default character limit for a all columns that had it - previously if ```text```, ```email```, ```model_function```, ```model_function_attribute```, ```phone```, ```row_number```, ```select``` column had its contents bigger than 50 characters, it got shortened (_Something some[...]_); we've reduced this limit to 40 characters, so that more columns can fit into one screen by default; you can overwrite this default with ```'limit' => 50``` in your column;
- checklist_dependency field now uses array for name;
- date_range field now uses array for names;


### Removed
- CrudControllers now come with zero operations and zero routes by default; old EntityCrudControllers should now specifically mention which operations should be loaded, using operation traits;
- ```CRUD::route()``` is no longer the way to load routes for a CrudController, but ```Route::crud()```;
- merged #1994 - moved SaveActions methods to the CrudPanel object;
- no CRUD access is provided by defaul; access is automatically given when using an operation trait on an EntityCrudController;
- Backpack/Base as a separate package; It's now included in Backpack/CRUD;
- AdminLTE dependency;
- Backpack/Generators from the installation command;
- Laracasts/Laravel-Generators from the installation command;
- Since all Backpack/Base/app classes have been moved to Backpack/CRUD/app, when upgrading to 4.0 you need to do a search-and-replace in all your application files; search for "Backpack/Base/app" and replace with "Backpack/CRUD/app"; make sure you include the following folders: app, config, resources/views, routes;
- If you're importing or extending our BaseController (```Backpack/Base/app/Http/Controllers/BaseController``` or ```Backpack/CRUD/app/Http/Controllers/BaseController```) anywhere inside your app, know that that controller is no longer needed. It's identical to ```Illuminate\Routing\Controller```, so you can use that instead. We haven't removed the file in this version yet, but it's considered deprecated and will be removed in the next version;

- CRUD Alias for handling the routes. Now instead of defining a Route::resource() and a bunch of other routes if you need reorder/translations etc, you only define CRUD:resource() instead (same syntax) and the CrudServiceProvider will define all the routes you need. That, of course, if you define 'CRUD' => 'Dick\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider' in your config/app.php file, under 'aliases'.


## [0.8.0] - 2015-09-09

### Added
- CRUD Multi-language editing. If the EntityCrudController's "details_row" is set to true, by default the CRUD will output the translations for that entity's row. Tested and working add, edit, delete and reordering both for original rows and for translation rows.

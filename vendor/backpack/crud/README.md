Quickly build an admin interface for your Eloquent models. Then customize every little detail. Among its features:

- List operation
   - 24+ column types
   - 1-1, 1-n and n-n relationships
   - table view with search, pagination
   - click column header to sort by it
   - custom buttons
   - details row
   - bulk actions
   - easily create new column types
   - easily overwrite an existing column type
- Create / Update operations
   - 50+ field types
   - back-end validation using Laravel Form Requests
   - translatable models (multi-language)
   - have multiple fields per line
   - split fields into tabs
- Delete / Bulk Delete operations
- Clone / Bulk Clone operations
- Reorder operation
- Revisions operation (audit log)

But professionals don't love Backpack just because it's feature-packed. They also love it because it's ridiculously easy to overwrite a functionality. Generally, you just need to create a function with the right name or create a blade file with the right name. Yes, it can be _that_ easy. See why thousands of Laravel professionals have been using Backpack, every day, since 2016.

## Getting started

Start with the ["Getting Started" series](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/introduction) in our docs. We try to nudge you towards creating a Backpack acccount, but you don't _need_ one, if you're just trying it out.

Alternatively, if you don't have 20 minutes right now, subscribe to our [drip email tutorial](https://backpackforlaravel.com/getting-started-emails). You'll receive one email per day, for 5 days, 5 minutes each. By the end, you'll be familiar with how Backpack works, and be able to create admin panels for your Laravel apps.

> ### Security updates and breaking changes
> If you're using Backpack in production, please **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We never _ever_ share your email with anyone & we try to send as few emails as possible (1-4 emails per year). We hate unsolicited email too. But... you know... you're building an admin panel, security _should_ be something you're up-to-date with.

## Versioning

When installing Backpack, require its minor version (currently ```4.0.*```). For us, this is what ```major.minor.patch``` means:

- ```major``` - **PAID upgrade; MAJOR breaking changes;** historically every 2-3 years; upgrading may take even 2-3 hours; includes major new features, major changes in how the whole system works, and complete rewrites; it allows us to _considerably_ improve the product, and add features that were previously impossible;
- ```minor``` - **FREE upgrade; MINOR breaking changes**; historically every 6-12 months; upgrading takes less than 30 minutes; it allows us to add big new features, for free;
- ```patch``` - **FREE upgrade; NO breaking changes**; historically every week; upgrading can be done automatically with composer; includes bug fixes and non-breaking new features;

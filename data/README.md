# COVID-19 Lung ultrasound dataset

We build a dataset of lung ultrasound images and videos. The dataset combines data from collaborating hospitals as well as publicly available resources from the web (e.g. publications and educational websites).

## Train/test split
**Due to multiple papers that used our dataset incorrectly, we are adding the following disclaimer: Please make sure to create a meaningful train/test data split. Do not split the data on a frame-level, but on a video/patient-level. The task becomes trivial otherwise because consecutive LUS frames are extremely correlated. We provide scripts to create a cross-validation split for you. See the instructions [here](../pocovidnet/#cross-validation-splitting).**

## Current dataset size (January 2021)

   <em>Current size of the dataset. Most samples use the convex probe. To our knowledge, 
   this is the largest public source of COVID-19 LUS data. 
   </em>
</p>

- Convex:
  - 162 videos (46x COVID, 49x bacterial pneumonia, 64x healthy, 3x viral pneumonia).
  - 20 videos from the Butterfly dataset (18 COVID, 2 healthy).
  - 53 images (18x COVID, 20x bacterial pneumonia, 15x healthy).
- Linear:
  - 20 videos (6x COVID, 2x bacterial pneumonia, 9x healthy, 3x viral pneumonia).
  - 6 images (4x COVID, 2x bacterial pneumonia).
  - 45 videos of *possible* COVID-19 patients collected in Piacenza at the peak of the crisis in Italy; there were not enough PCR tests available, so the label is not clear.

The dataset is continuously updated.


## Contribute!
- Please help us to find more data! Open an
  [issue](https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_pocus_ultrasound/issues) if you
  identified a promising data source. Please check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-tLMjMod6W-nAjkuxmO0CLsiyalFIOp92k_XD_yeo8/edit#gid=1181682638) whether the data is already included.
  Useful contributions are clean lung ultrasound videos available via Creative Commons license, e.g.:
   - Publications with ultrasound videos as electronic supplement
   - Websites like [The Pocus Atlas](https://thepocusatlas.com), [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/) or [Liftl](https://litfl.com/ultrasound-library/).

## Collect Data from sources without CC license 

**NOTE**: If you use this dataset for your own research, we recommend only using the data directly hosted in this repository.

#### Unlicensed data
Some data used in our [study](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/2/672) was obtained from public sources, but cant be redistributed on this repository due to licensing restrictions.
We therefore provide a script `get_and_process_web_data.sh` which users can use to download the data and process it for inclusion and reproduction of our study.
The provided script only works on Unix distributions (**not on Windows!**) and requires that you have python3 installed.

```sh
sh get_and_process_web_data.sh
```
After executing this script, a lot of data will have been added into your local `pocus_images` and `pocus_videos` folder.
Please note that for this freshly added data, all rights are reserved. 

#### Butterfly
To obtain the data from Butterfly please complete the following steps (in addition to executing `get_and_process_web_data.sh`)

**NOTE:** We can not provide a script to crop the butterfly videos and remove artifacts due to data licensing. The following code only selects the videos that we used for our experiments, renames them, and sorts them into the correct folders.

1. Visit the [COVID-19 ultrasound_gallery](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/covid-19#gallery)
   of Butterfly, scroll to *Download Gallery* and download the videos (we accessed this
   source on 17.04.2020 for training our models). Please note that it is not
   under control whether Butterfly will keep this data online. Feel free to
   notify us if you observe any changes).
2. Place the `.zip` folder into the this folder (`data`)
3. `cd` into the `data` folder.
4. Run:
```sh
sh parse_butterfly.sh
```
*NOTE*: This step requires that you installed the `pocovidnet` package
    before (see "Installation").
    
All butterfly videos should have been added to `data/pocus_videos/convex`.


## License Note:
*NOTE 1*: The founders/authors of the repository take no responsibility or liability for the data contributed to this archive. The contributing sites have to ensure that the collection and use of the data fulfills all applicable legal and ethical requirements.

*NOTE 2*: For every source of this dataset, individual licenses apply. Users have the responsibility to verify whether the individual licenses allow the desired usage. We exclude any liability for any of such cases.

*NOTE 3*: For the unlicensed data, users have the responsibility to verify whether their desired usage is allowed. We exclude any liability for any use by others.

The data from Neuruppin is licensed under [`CC BY 4.0`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The data contributed from Northumbria hospital is licensed under [`CC BY NC 4.0`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

### Scraped data
All videos/images provided in this repo which were collected from public sources have a license specified in the `dataset_metadata.csv`.
We provide links to the respective licenses and indicate whether (and which) changes were made.



## Updates
- **24.10.2020**: Dataset metadata (patient age, gender, symptoms, ID, etc.) included (see #58).
- **26.9.2020**: Major update to the database: 30 videos from Dr Avinash Aujayeb from Northumbria, and 45 linear videos of COVID-19 patients sponsored by Bolzano AG
- **25.8.2020**: Update - added 10 new videos from the Northumbria hospital
- **12.8.2020**: Update - added 14 new COVID videos from publications
- **28.7.2020**: Update - added 4 new videos and 7 new images from the Northumbria hospital
- **11.7.2020**: Database update - We added an up to date csv file with all metadata, and new videos that were contributed from the Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital (17 images and 4 videos of healthy patients)
- **22.6.2020**: Database update - We added 46 new videos (18x COVID, 1x bacterial pneumonia, 27x healthy).
- **16.5.2020**: The [ICLUS
  project](https://www.disi.unitn.it/iclus) released ~60 videos
  from COVID-patients (register [here](https://covid19.disi.unitn.it/iclusdb/login)). 


## Add class "uninformative"
In the current state, a user could input any image, e.g. of a house, and still receive a classification result as COVID-19 / pneumonia / healthy.
In order to prevent this, we decided to include a fourth class called "uninformative", where we add Imagenet images and neck-ultrasound data from the Kaggle Nerve Segmentation Challenge.
Download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bAbCJCq-U5vIxbG0ySUKanAW_pW_z2O4) from google drive. It contains a folder *uniform_class_nerves* and one *uniform_class_imagenet*.
The data can be immediately used for training, simply combine it in a folder *uninformative* next to the *covid*, *pneumonia* and *regular* folders.
If you want to add them to an existing cross validation split (e.g after executing [cross_val_splitter](../pocovidnet/scripts/cross_val_splitter.py)), we also provide a script:

Run:
```
python ../pocovidnet/scripts/add_uninformative_class.py -i uniform_class_imagenet -u uniform_class_nerves -o cross_validation -s 5
```

This script will split the data in the *uniform_class_nerves* and *uniform_class_imagenet* folders and add them in a folder *uninformative* to each fold.
